## solution of wave equation using FEM
To solve the wave equation for all suitable geometries execute `fem.m` with Matlab (tested with Matlab R2016a).
The path it is executed in must contain a folder `Finite_Elemente` which contains the geometry files.

Plots for the some interesting geometries including the drums and the square are created and the analytical solutions of the square geometry are plotted as well.
